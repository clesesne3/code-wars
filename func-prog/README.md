### Problem Domain

1. Make the double() function return a new array with each value twice as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array. Your solution must use the map() function of the built-in javascript Array object. If you're not familiar with map(), reading over the documentation may help.

2. In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.

3. Write function avg which calculates average of numbers in given list.
